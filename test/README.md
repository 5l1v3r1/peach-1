Peach Fuzz - Test
=================

This directory houses test sources, scripts and executables for the peach scanners to try their luck on. These scripts are _probably_ harmless, but you should not just go around running them. If you add new ones, they should be harmless. Simply demonstrating some basic vulnerabilities like SQL injection, printf/scanf, buffer overflows, etc.
